INBOUND

Inbound Leads  [ Software to be familiar with - Salesforce, Outreach, Outlook, ScheduleOnce ]
Leads can come in from prospect filling out our form from website [ Request Demo, Free Account Review, etc ]

Email alert comes in to the assigned rep let us know what action they took on our webste
The lead automatically [ within minutes of being completed by user ] gets brought into Salesforce, Outreach, and is sequenced [ put into a communication schedule of emails and calls ]
Daily Tasks are generated from Outreach which will let you know when to call a lead; emails are delivered automatically (one the previous task has been completed)
Once you speak with the lead, you qualify them [ 6 different points ], and then schedule a time for a demonstration or not if they don't qualify

The Six Point Qualification
-- Do they have more than 100 products selling on their domain?
-- Are they located in the United States?
-- Do they speak english?
-- Are they using an ecommerce platform?
-- Is their website clean and functional. i.e. modern, easily navigable
-- Is that same website mobile friendly

Use ScheduleOnce to schedule demonstration through a calendar invitation [ email reminders are sent from this program ]

Send email introduction with lead and assigned AE  [ Use SDR Central, an excel doc, to determine which AE is up for a demonstration in rotation - enter in lead information into doc ]
Enter date Demo was scheduled
Your initials
Name of the company
Link to the Salesforce URL [ required ]

Lead comes into Live Chat, starting the conversation
Answer the questions that come in from Live Chat
Ask for their contact information (email, phone #) to reach out to them directly
Attempt to schedule a demo, otherwise, place them into sequence "Inbound_Lead_Live_Chat" via Outreach
