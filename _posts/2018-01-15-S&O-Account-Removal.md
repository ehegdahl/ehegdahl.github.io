Click on the red button that says ‘Click Here To Revoke Access To Google’
After you delete all users and remove google authentication, switch over to a different active account in the sales and orders app.

Then click on the new active account name drop down menu in the upper right hand corner and select ‘All Accounts’
Using the search bar, search the name of the account you are removing from the S&O App but DO NOT click into the account
Instead look for the Actions column on the far right > select the trash bin icon to delete the account
You will be prompted ‘Are you sure?’ > select yes
Then the account will be removed from S&O
