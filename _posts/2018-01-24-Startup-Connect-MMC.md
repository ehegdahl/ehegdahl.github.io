Connect Client to MCC

Once You Have Access - Connect the client to our MCC account, unless they are an agency. Agencies do not get added to our MCC.

To add an account to our MCC:
Log in to Our MCC Account

Select Add Account (the red + Account button on the accounts homepage) > add the correct account ID and enter the account domain name > continue to link
Log into the Client’s AdWords Account

Click the Gear Icon in the Top Right > Choose Account Settings
Click on Account Access
At the bottom, click Accept next to our Company's Name

Once they are added to Our MCC, make sure we are listed first under the Client Managers Section.
This is located in the client’s AdWords account > Settings Gear Icon > Account Settings > Account Access
If we are not listed first talk to the client to see if there are any users no longer active that we can remove. If they do not wish to remove the other users, ask if we can make changes to allow us to be listed first.

Note: We will not be given credit if we are not listed first.
