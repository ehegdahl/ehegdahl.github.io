Website Health Check

Go to the Domainname.com

Use the Google Chrome Tag assistant to verify the Analytics Code on their website.

Verify that the UA Code is the same as the Analytics ID we have access to.   
The analytics ID is the UA number found in Analytics under the main drop down menu > under Properties & APPS

If the IDs do not match up, take a screenshot of the Analytics ID listed on the Google Chrome Tag Assistant and email it to the client; CC: Ed Apana.
Remove any unnecessary Codes that you see listed on their website via Tag Assistant
Check the website to make sure you are able to checkout.
Check the Website to make sure they have a Secure Checkout [ dedicated is preferred, but Shared SSL is alright as long as it is secure ]
Wappalyzer should also be installed, This app will allow you to check what platform the client is using
