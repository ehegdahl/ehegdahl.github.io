OUTREACH

Tasks will be generated by Outreach with emails, calls, and other tasks for you to contact leads. This sequence runs every 30 days [ give or take ]
Once you speak with lead, explain what our software is, and schedule a demonstration based off of what they can learn

Use ScheduleOnce to schedule demonstration through a calendar invitation (email reminders are sent this program)

Send email introduction with lead and assigned AE (Use SDR Central to determine which AE is up for a demonstration in rotation - enter in lead information into doc)
